This runs search-cfg.py - the config file on on the event file that follows

Current config file: search-cfg.py

Seed Threshold - for an event to be considered a seed, it must have a normalized amplitude greater than this value
appears as prod.seed_thresh in search-cfg.py 

Path Veto Threshold - a possible seed is projected along its path through the next five layers, if a neighbour to have an amplitude greater than this the path veto count goes up by 1

Path Veto Count - the maximum number of neigbhours that can have an amplitude above the path veto threshold, before the  possible seed is rejected

Noise Threshold - when choosing events along the projected path of the seed, throw away any event with neighbour cells having amplitudes greater than this.
